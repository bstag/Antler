- **Component Architecture**: Reusable UI components built with Astro and React
- **Advanced Theming**: Light/dark mode with CSS custom properties
- **Serverless Forms**: Contact form handling with Supabase integration
- **Performance Optimized**: Static generation with selective hydration

## Technical Highlights

The project showcases several advanced concepts:

- **Island Architecture**: JavaScript only loads where needed
- **Content Schema Validation**: Type-safe content with Zod schemas
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **SEO Optimization**: Semantic HTML and meta tag management

## Development Process

Built using a documentation-driven approach, starting with comprehensive product requirements and technical architecture documents. The implementation follows modern best practices for maintainability and scalability.

This project serves as both a functional SSG and a reference implementation for modern web development patterns.
