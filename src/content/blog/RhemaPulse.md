Every week, pastors pour hours into crafting sermons that inspire, challenge, and transform lives. But what happens after the final "Amen"? For most churches, those powerful messages disappear into a folder of unlabeled audio files—or worse, are lost entirely.

What if every sermon you've ever preached could be instantly searchable, organized, and ready to repurpose?

### The Problem Every Pastor Knows
If you're in ministry, you've experienced this: Someone asks, "Remember that sermon you preached about grace? The one where you quoted Ephesians?" And you spend the next hour digging through recordings or notes, trying to remember which Sunday that was.

Or maybe you want to turn a sermon series into a book, create social media content from your best quotes, or prepare discussion questions for small groups. The raw material is there—locked inside audio files that take an hour to listen through for every hour of content.

Traditional transcription services help, but they still leave you with walls of unformatted text to sift through.

### Enter RhemaPulse
RhemaPulse takes a different approach. Instead of just transcribing your sermons, it understands them.

Upload your sermon audio (or paste a transcript), and within minutes you get:

- Full Transcript – Accurate, AI-powered transcription
- Sermon Summary – The core message distilled into a few paragraphs
- Scripture Detection – Every Bible reference identified and cataloged with full verse text
- Memorable Quotes – Your most quotable moments extracted automatically
- Key Highlights – Main points with supporting sub-points
- Action Items – Practical next steps for your congregation
- Discussion Questions – Ready-made prompts for small groups

### Who Is This For?
- Pastors – Build a searchable archive of every sermon. Track which scriptures you've covered. Repurpose content for blogs, books, and social media in a fraction of the time.

- Small Group Leaders – Stop spending hours creating discussion guides. RhemaPulse generates questions and summaries you can share with your group the same day as the sermon.

- Dedicated Note-Takers – Never miss a powerful point again. Create a personal library of teachings you can search by topic, scripture, or keyword.

### The Technology Behind It
RhemaPulse is powered by Google's Gemini AI, the same technology behind some of the most advanced language understanding systems available today. Using a modern Front end and dynamic backend it is ready for what ever the word throws at it.
